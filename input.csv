Description of Inputs:

First line: Do not change.
Second line: Number of Maxwell modes in the relaxation spectrum of the fluid.
Third line: Strengths of the Maxwell modes.
Fourth line: Relaxation times of the Maxwell modes.
Fifth line: Purely frictional element in the relaxation spectrum of the fluid.
Sixth line: Trap stiffness.
Seventh line: Sensitivity of photo-detector.
Eight line: Uncertainty in the sensitivity.
Ninth line: For how long to run the simulation (dimensionless time).
Tenth line: Time step of the simulation.
Eleventh line: An integer number to set the random number seed.

Input the strengths of the Maxwell modes normalized by the trap stiffness.
Input the relaxation times normalized by the smallest relaxation time.
Put nm=0 in the second row and leave the third and fourth 
row empty to simulate a bead in a purely viscous fluid.
