Description of Inputs:

First line: Do not change.
Second line: Number of Maxwell modes in the relaxation spectrum of the fluid.
Third line: Strengths of the Maxwell modes.
Fourth line: Relaxation times of the Maxwell modes.
Fifth line: Purely frictional element in the relaxation spectrum of the fluid.
Sixth line: Trap stiffness.
Seventh line: Sensitivity of photo-detector.
Eight line: For how long to run the simulation (dimensionless time).
Ninth line: Time step size of the simulation.
Tenth line: An integer number to set the random number seed.

Input the strengths of the Maxwell modes normalized by the trap stiffness.
Input the relaxation times normalized by the smallest relaxation time.
Put nm=0 in the second row and leave the third and fourth 
row empty to simulate a bead in a purely viscous fluid.
Time is made dimensionless by the shortest relaxation time of the 
fluid and length is made dimensionless by the 
sqrt(2kBT/he). Where KB is the Boltzmann constant and T
is the temperature.
